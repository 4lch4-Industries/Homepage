# 4lch4 Industries, LLC

4lch4 Industries, LLC. is my ([4lch4][0]) company that I created when I was a freelance developer. It was initially called HassleFree Solutions, LLC. but I changed it about a year after to 4lch4 Industries, LLC. The only real reason behind the name change was I wanted a company that had my primary alias in it.

## Purpose

Since I got a full-time position as a Software Engineer/Operations Engineer at [J.B. Hunt Transportation][1] I no longer do freelance work. Instead, the company is now used for publishing various Open Source projects. If the project is something that could potentially be used by more folks than a simple library, I publish it under the 4lch4 Industries name.
